# Noita Arena
**A online PvP Arena mod for Noita**  
This mod has been in beta for a while but I thought i'd finally make it more publically accessible.  
The list of features is too large to write down at this point but let me give you a little taste:
- Rounds style online PvP.
- Completely configurable lobbies, with settings for basically everything imaginable.
- A death zone to keep people from flying off into space. (Can be made to move over time for that fortnite experience)
- A card system which can be enabled where players get to pick a card whenever the round ends.
- Different types of shops which can be finetuned all the way.
- Lobby presets
- Configurable spell blacklist
- Configurable perk blacklist
- In-game scoreboard
- Ready indicator
- Probably a lot of things I forgot about
